# SkillAPI-s
This fork adds back support to the now unmaintained SkillAPI plugin, the last maintainer was Sentropic, thanks to these great developers.
If you encounter a problem or have any suggestions, please open an issue here. I canâ€™t guarantee to solve these problems, but I will try.

## Building

You can download it at [Actions](https://github.com/MoeArea/SkillAPI/actions/workflows/maven.yml).
or you can build it yourself by using `mvn install` command, Please make sure you have installed Maven before executing this command.

## New dynamic editor
If you use this version, I strongly recommend using the maintained Dynamic editor.
Skills made with the old editor should still maintain full functionality, but the new one has new stuff.
